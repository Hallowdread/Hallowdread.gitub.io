# grid_bizz.gitub.io
A Responsive Grid Website Made With HTML &amp; CSS

I watched the tutorial on how to create this on: https://youtu.be/moBhzSC455o

Only the home page is available at the moment...i'll complete the rest of the pages one day. 

You can clone the code and import on your code editor then run on your local web browser.

Thank You!!
